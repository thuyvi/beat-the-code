<h2 style="font-size:30px">2019 resolution: I will answer the question: HOW HARD TO BECOME AN EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY EXPERT WITH LIMITED TECHNOLOGY SKILLS? WILL KNOWLEDGE IS ENOUGH?</h2>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;color:blue">December 2018</h2>
<br>Start a Course on Udemy. Let's see if this can help me get more knowledge than running around reading like what I am doing.
<br>Get a FreeCodeCamp account. I think this one seems like w3schools from which I keep getting the basic knowledge. 
<br>I think I should start with a real small project to use what I have learned about HTML/CSS/Javascript. I will build a blog for 2 people. I have searched for reference about this kind of blog but still have no glue if anyone has done it yet. 
<br>Happy New Year!

<br>I have just finished the 1st part of tutorial to write the first Web app. It's freaking difficult. 
<br>There are so many things I can't understand groundly. I keep telling me that "ok, don't think much. Just like a baby learn news language, I will understand them eventually". That way, am I doing wrong?

<br>Today is my birthday. I had good time with my beloved host family and my friends. I miss my family in Vietnam so much. 
<br>I keep stuyding javascript these days. It was not really hard. However, the fact is that I don't use it for pratical projects stops me from remembering it. I just want to have an overview of it before jump into PhP. 
<br>As I get busier with research paper and doing part-time job, I was distracted much. Let's stay up late a bit everynight to keep track.
