I will start to write Django app. I want to slowly learn how to code full stack website.
<br>
Another thing that I need to work on is <a href="http://www.mysqltutorial.org/"><b>database server</b></a>. I don't understand it much :(

My research paper has been approval to start with data collection stage. I will not have much time for coding. I hope I still can balance the researching tasks to fulfill this goal.

<br>I have just finished the 1st part tutorial to write the first Django app. It's freaking difficult. 
<br>There are so many things I can't understand groundly. I keep telling me that "ok, don't think much. Just like a baby learn news language, I will understand them eventually". That way, am I doing wrong?
